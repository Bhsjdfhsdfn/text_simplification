Provides abstraction and support for the language model feature function typically used in
hierarchical phrase-based decoding for statistical machine translation.

The classes contained within this directory are responsible for two tasks: implementing the feature
function, and representing the language model itself.  The class `LanguageModelFF` implements the
feature function by exending the class `DefaultStatefulFF`.  One of these is instantiated for each
language model present in the decoder.

The language models themselves are implemented as a combination of an interface
(`NGramLanguageModel`), a default implementation (`DefaultNgramLangaugeModel`), and an abstract
implementation of the default (`AbstractLM`).
